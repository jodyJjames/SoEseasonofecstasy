Black-river-cross
Deep in the jungle-Black River (Tobago Legend Spot)
early afternoon
Jody Tulom Shorty, hallucinated villagers from the past
PROPS- machetes, river raft, torn maps, old forest markings, wild fruits , herbs
**Visual Tone- mystical realism
###Visual summary
Jody and the crew reach the mystical black river-said to be cursed
The jungle seems to lean in, sunlight flickers unnaturally
They build a * makeshift raft *  using vine bamboo and bush skills
Mid-way across the black still water visions begin
**Jody see's an old villager in the tree's -his dead grandfather**
Shorty laughs nervously but wipes tears from his eyes
Tulom mutters prayers in patois under his breath
## Dialogue
Tulom- " This river eat people soul if yuh cross without truth"
Shorty-(tense) -" I aint never believe in all that until now "
*Jody*-(eyes locked on vision)-"You used to tell me dont run from pain. So i wont *(beat)* "watch meh now grampa"
###Action The raft creaks. something massive swims beneath them.
Jody drops a handful of herbs into the river-a **ritual from childhood**  . 
A **hallucination of Jody as a boy** appears in the trees and dives in
He jumps after the vision instinctively nearly drowning.
Tulom saves him. When he surfaces, *he's changed*- less angry , more focused
###NOTES
Symbolic baptism for Jody
first full mystical hallucintion sequence
Black River will be referenced again in the climax-the river judges all
Strengthens bond among the trio
###Music Cue
**"LOSE CONTROL"-Medz Boss(instrumental loop)**
echoed with ambient forest sounds warped slightly as hallucinations kicks in
