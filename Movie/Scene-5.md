#Scene 5 "Enter Dennis"
**Location** Old colonial-style house, gated, near the water in Westmoorings
**Time** Night
**Visual Style** Dim, warm light spilling through slatted wooden blinds. Expensive rum on the table. Fan blades turning. The room smells like cigars and power.
###Characters:
**Dennis** - clean-cut, intimidating, exudes old-school gangster elegance
**Shorty** - a little out of his depth here
**Jody** - quiet, watching
**One Enforcer** - silent, in the corner with a bulge in his shirt
### Scene Breakdown
Camera tracks Shorty and Jody walking up a long corridor with marble tiles
Doors open - Dennis sits alone, glass in hand
Silence, then: "Come in"
### Dialogue:
**Dennis:**
*(soft, deliberate)*
"so. This is the man from Matelot."
**Jody**
*(nods, respectful but not scared)*
"You needed someone quiet. I hear things move quieter up there."
**Dennis:**
*(to Shorty, not Jody)*
"He always talk in riddles?
**Shorty**
*(nervous chuckle)*
"All the time. But when is time for work-he is beast." 
**Dennis**
*(leans foward)*
"we move tomorrow night. Boat ride. Not the tourist kind. Everything in place . You dont ask what it is-you just make sure it reach."
**Jody**
*(cool)*
"And if something go wrong?"
**Dennis**
*(smiles without humor)*
"Then I bury two things-the problem, and the men who let it happen."
### Soundtrack Cue ;
**Wanted Dead or Alive" (steelpan instrumental mix)**
Heavy bass under pan melody - tension plus tropical elegance
### Energy:
Dennis is a storm that speaks calmly. He's a boss with reach.
Jody just stepped into a **world of calculated violence**
## Hints for later
The **"boat ride" job** will be **Scene 6** - and it wont go clean
The **Enforcer** will show up again as trouble
Dennis is playing **his own long game** with Jody as a pawn
