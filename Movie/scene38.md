A misty mangrove swamp, still and haunting.
Early morning light barely pierces through the thick canopy. The air is heavy with silence, broken only by the sloshing of boots in the mud
Jody(solemn,haunted
Shorty(quiet,reserved)
Dennis ( eyes full of regret)
Tulom (back in his element, focused
Mother(voiceover) (memory of a warning)
##Visual style
Overcast, cold color grading-stark contrast to the tropical vibrancy of earlier scenes
slow, quiet canopy
###Dialogue & action
[wide shot- The team arrives by boat through the swampy estuary]
Tulom (whispering)
"He said to bury him near the roots. He said his father showed him this spot once. Deepest part of the village. No law, no devil reachin' here
[Jody climbs onto land and helps Dennis lift Kevins wrapped body . They move with care and reverence]
Shorty(softly)- "he was an ass, but he was our ass."
Dennis(whispers)
And I made him worse. WhatvI wouldnt give to undo half the shit we done
[they lower the body into a shallow grave dug under mangrove roots
Jody-"you ever think we were the villains?
Tulom - "we were just boys trying to survive in a rigged game"
[Jody pauses, takes a ring out his pocket. It's Kevin's ring-a lion head]
Jody (speaking to the grave)
"you shoulda made it, bro. you had the loudest voice and the smallest heart. And now the silence louder than all of it.
[He drops the ring in the grave]
Mother(v,o)
"When blood spill in water...it never wash away.it become part of yuh skin"
[they begin covering the grave with dirt. No prayers. just motion]
[Drone shot- The camera slowly rises, showing them disappearing in the canopy]
