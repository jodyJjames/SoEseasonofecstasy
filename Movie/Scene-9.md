# Scene 9- The Drop
**Location:** Isolated gravel road just outside Port Of Spain
**Time:** Nightfall
**Characters** Kevin, Dennis, Enforcer (first appearance), Driver, Mysterious Buyer (voice only)
### Visual Summary:
Kevin sits in the backseat of a sleek black SUV.
Dennis is in the passenger seat. Tension between them
Enforcer sits behind the driver - ice cold, no emotion, mask on.
They arrive at the old industrial dockyard lit by one lone floodlight.
A burner phone rings. Kevin answers, speaks with the buyer.
They unload a briefcase filled with "test product" - glossy packaging, neon labeled capsules. 
Kevin flashes a half smile. The deal is almost done - but the Buyer hint at knowing more than he should.
Suspense builds.
### Dialogue :
**[Kevin]**
"let him know we here. And brought dessert."
**[Dennis]** *(dry)*
"Funny. You makin jokes now, Kev?"
**[Kevin]**
"Somebody gotta lighten the mood. You tense like a man with two baby mothers in the same party."
**[Enforcer]** (quietly)* "They watchin' . Driver, lights off. Now"
*(lights cut. A burner phone on the Dash starts ringing.)*
**[Kevin]** *(answers)*
"Yeah."
**[Mysterious Buyer - voice only]**
" You're late. I hope the product is worth the wait."
**[Kevin]**
"You'll call it love at first bite" wanna taste ?
**[Buyer - voice only]*
" I already know what it tastes like.  What i dont know is if you're clean.
The streets whisper, Kevin. And lately , they're loud."
*(Kevin's smile fades just slightly. He nods to Enforcer, who opens the case.)
### Scene Energy:
Serious tension .
First appearance of Enforcer > heavy presence.
Kevin still cool, but pressure is creeping in.
Dennis is watching everything- like he's starting to doubt.
Buyer is mysterious, dangerous-*puppetmaster vibes.*
### Music cue:
**"M.A.A.D City' - kendrick Lamar**
(insrumental underlay, wraped and slow, for tension)
