# Scene 11 - "The Tunnel"
**Location** Underground storm drain tunnel behind a rum bar in St.James
**Time** Midnight
**Characters** Jody, 2 stray dogs,
Flashbacks of Tulom, Rat scurries, Shorty(brief voiceover), Sound of police sirens muffled above
### Visual Summary :
Jody entars the tunnel, flashlight flickering.
Concrete walls soaked, tagged with graffiti and crude carvings.
Dripping water, scuttling rats. The tunnel echoes every breath.
He hears Tulom's voice again, but this time its coming from inside the tunnel- a memory bleeding into hallucination.
He flashes back to the last time he and Tulom were in this tunnel as kids, hiding stolen snacks and weed.
The memory fades, Jody stumbles into a sleeping dog. It growls . Another behind it blocks the way.
Jody stands still. Calm. Then whistles a rhythm- the same one from childhood.
The Dogs recognize it. They back off.
As he moves forward, Shorty's voice buzzes over the walkie:
*"You coming out under the bridge, When you see the light, run."*
### Dialogue:
**[Jody]** *(to himself)*
"Same tunnel, same smell. Only difference... everybody gone,"
**[Tulom-echo memory]*
"You really think you could run forever, bro?"
**[Jody]**
"I not runnin' . I just not done yet."
*(Dogs growl. He freezes, then whistles a short melody.)*
**[Shorty-walkie]*
"You comin' out under the bridge. When you see the light - run."
### Scene Energy:
Claustrophobic and emotional.
Past and present start to blur.
Small threats build big tension.
A turning point - Jody is finally trusting instinct over panic.
Feels like he's stepping into his fate now.
### Music Cue:
**"Runaway" - Kanye West (intro piano plus ambient echo only)**
*Echoes in the Background, reverberating through the tunnel*
