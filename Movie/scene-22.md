Blood and Bamboo
Bamboo cathedral trail, deep Tobago
Dusk
Jody, Tulom Shorty Enforcer squad
PROPS- Trini cutlasses, walkie talkies, flare gun, spilled blood, wild bamboo thicket
**Visual Tone** Blade runner meets jungle warfare
###Visual summary
As the sun sets , they cut their way through towering bamboostalks
The silence is sharp **too quiet**
Tulom halts, sniffing the air.
Then -BAM!**gunshots ring out through the bamboo
Jody dives, Tulom flips behind a root,Shorty screams and disappears
###Dialogue
Tulom-(calm)-" dem come. I tell yuh...jungle."
JODY-(gritting teeth)-"Shorty?!!Shorty!?"
unkown voice on radio- "deliver the package... or we collect flesh"
###Action
The bamboo tunnel becomes a *war zone*
Jody fights back with a machete, slashing shadows
Tulom goes full ghost mode-using scent,hearing,and instinct
They lose track of Shorty. Only **his bloody bandana** is found
Tulom lights a flare and the enemy vanishes-for now
###Notes
Major tone shift
Jody's rage builds again
Tulom proves he is more that comic relief-
-he's a warrior
Shorty's disappearance becomes persoal for Jody
Drops clues: the enforcers are from **Dennis camp**
###Music cue
*"No Friends"-Skeng(remix instrumental)
Heavy jungle drums with eerie wind chimes layered in
