# Scene-8 - "Jody's Escape
**Location** Rocky hillside trail above Diego Martin
**Time** Dusk, golden-orange horizon light
**Characters** Jody, Tulom (flashback/hallucination), Shorty (via walkie), Kev's boys(searching)
### Visual Summary :
Jody is muddy, limping, and wild eyed, barely holding it together.
He ducks behind rocks, listens to voices echoing as Kev's boys search.
He suddenly sees Tulom - his old friend, shirtless and glowing- sitting on a rock like a spirit.
Tulom talk like he's alive. Jody argues.
But Tulmo is calm, wise, hilarious.
Tulom disappears mid sentence . Jody freaks, then gets a call from Shorty: **"You movin mad bro. Lay low . They out heavy , d place hot."**
Jody grabs his rusty bicycle hidden in the bushes and rides off downhill like a manman.
### Dialogue:
**[Jody]**
(whispering, crouched)
"shhh. They close..."
**[Tulom]** *(appearing out of nowhere)*
"Dawg... yuh smell like rainwater and goat piss. What kinda plan is this?"
**[Jody]**
"...You dead. You not real. You dead!"
**[Tulom}** *(grinning)*
"Yeah but I still got better ideas than you."
**{Kev's Boys, distant}**
"He went that way! Check the ridge !"
**{Jody}** *(sarcastic panicking slightly)*
"I ent ready for this madness nah..."
**(Tulom)** *(serious now)*
"Then get ready , is only you and d road now."
**[Shorty- walkie crackles]**
"Jody! Yo, dem man out here like ants, blood. You movin' mad. Lay low. You hear me?"
**[Jody]**(to himself, exhausted but driven)*
"Shorty...hold a corner fuh me, I comin down hot."
### Scene Energy:
Adrenaline and paranoia.
Flash of comic relief with Tulom's hallucination jokes.
Emotional weight of trauma and survival.
Ends with action shot- Jody racing down the hillside on a janky bike, hair in the wind like freedom is close.
### Music cue :
**"Cant Tell Me Nothing"-Kanye West**(starts slow, kicks in when Jody rides downhill)
