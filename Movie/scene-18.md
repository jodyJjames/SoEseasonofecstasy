*PROPs*   rum bottle, first aid kit, phone with cracked screen,  childhood photo , hammock, beach fire
###Visual summary
The crew is holdup at a rustic beach shack . Ocean waves crash in the distance
A small fire glows . Jody walks with a heavy limp, Shorty is asleep 
DJ Malick hums old calypso while watchin the waves
Tulom sits alone with a bottle, staring at the stars like they owe him something.
Jody pulls out an old photo of him and his cousin as boys
The woman who helped raise Jody enters the scene. her face lit by the firelight
###Dialoge Tulom- you ever win so hard you feel like you lost something bigger
Jody-(nursing a cut)-I never wanted to win. I just didnt want to drown
Woman-(soft, almost scolding)
is this the legacy yuh father left you? Or the one yuh inventing to make him look right?
DJ Malick (quiet, singing)
"Fire in we soul and nowhere to run"
[Phone rings - kevin, voice only]
" yuh think yuh got away Jody ?, Tobago comin. Yuh aint ready fuh that current"
###Action
Jody walks to the sea alone
Flashback : a younger Jody running on this very same beach, laughing
Back in present , he tosses the old photo into the fire
tulom turns and stares at the blaze , silent mouthing something
End on **close-up Shorty's eyes opening** , wide and haunted
###NOTES
This is the emotional detox scene
After the Carnival madness, we see what the motion cost them
The old woman's presents add's ancestral weight-"where yuh heading?" energy .
kevin's call sets up *Tobago arc* (the final movement of the film) 
###Music cue
**"Dust in yuh face"** - Bunji-Garlin (acoustic remix, slowed )
Begin softly when Jody walks to the water. wind picks up.
