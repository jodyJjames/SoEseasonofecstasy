Abandoned fishing depot, outskirts of Manzanilla
8.00 am
Shorty , cousin Dre , Flashback of uncle Roy (voice only)
Props- machete , chain-link, padlock, dusty old tackle box
VISUAL TONE- Harsh sunlight, gritty textures, emotionally raw
###Visual summary- Shorty kneels near a rusty chain nailed into a concrete slab
Flashbacks flicker; scenes of him as a child, chained by the legs for stealing fish .
He breathes heavy. A machete in hand.
##Dialogue
cousin Dre (off-camera, nervous) - "you alright, blood ? you blanked out."
Shorty (coldly)
"I ever tell you what Roy used to do when i get catch taking bait?"
[Dre] - "nah, bro"
Shorty(lifting chain) used to padlock my lil ass here. Said "Dogs that bite early become real monster"
###Emotional Climax- Shorty slams the machete down, slicing through the chain.
Echoes of uncle Roy's voice fade in. > "A man like you dont get to lose peace"
Shorty yells out, almost like a beast, releasing years of truama.
tosses the brken chain into the sea behind him
###music cue
"mama cry"-YNW Melly (piano instrumental only)
*Sparse, aching chords. no vocals. pure emotion.
