# Scene 7 - Cough Syrup and Consequences"
**Location** A dockside hideout (warehouse on stilts over the water)
**Time:** Dawn, just after the ambush
**Visual Style**
Muted greys and green tones. Dawn creeping in through broken slats. Seagulls in the distance. Water lspping beneath the floorboards.
### Characters
**Jody*8 - silently unraveling the clues
**Shorty** - bruised, rattled, smoking
**Enforcer (Kev)** - gut shot, but alive
**Old Lady Marlene** - unexpected healer, owns the hideout
**Background radio** - reporting strange cargo seizure in another port
### Scene Breakdown:
Jody stitches up Kevin while Shorty watches, pacing
Barrel is cracked open - **syrup jugs** inside, coded labels
Marlene mutters something cryptic: Dais not cough medicine. chile... dais blood money."
Jody removes a label: finds **layered lables beneath** some spanish and some Haitian Creole
They're  **smuggling codeine** and maybe something worse
Kev finally speaks:
" They said you didnt need to know"
Jody stares at him betrayed
### Dialogue:
**Shorty** (quietly)**
" you ever feel like we in the wrong f**king movie bro?"
**Kev (groaning)**
"This aint no small fish hustle, Dennis working for people that dont bleed easy"
**Jody:** " And you let me walk into it blind."
**Marlene (spitting in a bowl)**
"yuh better start walking with yuh eyes open, dread. Else next time they goin mail yuh mother yuh teeth
## Soundtrack cue:
**Sizzla- "Suffer (Lo-fi Remix)**
Playing low on Marlene's old radio - echoing over water
### What this scene unlocks
Jody knows **Dennis lied**
The syrup is coded - likely linked to **a Caribbean trafficking network***
Marlene hints at **spiritual consequences**, not just criminal
Kev confirms Dennis reports to someone *far more dangerous 
### Closing Shot:
Jody alone, looking out over the water
His phone buzzes
Message: **Come alone. Midnight. Coordinates sent**
He looks back at the cracked barrel
Cut to map on his phone screen - and the word:
**Tobago**

**Cut to black.**
