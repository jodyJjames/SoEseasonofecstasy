# Scene 13 - " The Rooftop Gospel "
**Location** Shorty's rooftop crash pad, overlooking the lights of Port of Spain
**Time** Early morning, just before sunrise-cool air, Stars fading
**Characters:** Jody, Shorty
**Props** Rum bottle, plastic chairs, old speaker playing riddim low, one lone candle flickering
### Visual Summary:
The city glows beneath them.
Jody is battered- shirtless, bruised, exhausted.
Shorty leans back in a broken chair, smoking
They talk over the rooftops, A brother-to-brother kind of honesty
Shorty tells Jody why he never left Trinidad when he had the chance.
Jody asks if they ever really had a shot.
Shorty answers with the most truthful thing in the movie so far.
Ends with them watching the sky lighten in silence, both thinking different thoughts.
### Dialogue:
**[Jody]** (sipping, voice low)*
"we ever really had a shot? or we was just born in a chokehold>"
**[Shorty]** *(grins, slow drag)*
"You ever see how bamboo bend in storm and still bounce back up ?
Thats we. We dont break. We just learn to move different."
**[Jody}** 
" so all this madness is what... part of the lesson?"
**{Shorty}** "bro we living in a world where even the stars get shot at.
So yeah ... maybe it is"
*(They sit silent. The candle flickers out. The sun starts peeking through the clouds.)*
### Scene Energy:
quiet and powerful.
No running, no shooting- just truth and reflection.
Caribbean philosophy with a ghetto gospel feel.
These two grew up in hellfire, and somehow still laugh and pour rum.
One of the most quotable scenesin the movie.
### Music Cue:
**"Heaven and Hell" - Kanye West x Buju Banton mashup**
*(lo-fi dub mix version playing quietly from Shorty'sspeaker)*
