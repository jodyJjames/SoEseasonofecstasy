# Scene 4 - " Shorty's Pitch"
**Location** Back of a bar, yard by the beach
**Time:** Evening
Visual Style:** Party lights strung over a sandy yard, old wooden fence, coolers full of beer. Real Trini lime vibes.
Afro-Caribbean music pulsing softly.
### Characters;
**Jody** - calm, calculated, cautious
**Shorty** - hype, funny, unpredictable, loyal
**Extras:** random friends liming, two girls dancing barefoot in sand
### Scene Breakdown;
Camera pushes through strin beads into the backyard
Shorty is barbecuing with no shirt, weed in hand
Jody approaches slow, nods to the people liming
A vibe in the air: somethings up
### Dialogue:
**Shorty:**   
> *grinning, flipping a piece of chicken)*
> "Yuh disappear like ghost, bredren. What happen. jungle life sweeter than woman now?"
> **Jody** *(smirking)
> "Bush peaceful. Less noise. Less snakes."
> **Shorty**
> *(laughs)*

**Jody**

> "A fella named Dennis. Man real cold. But sharp. Proffesional."
**Jody**

> *(pauses)*
> "yuh know him?"
**Jody:**
> *(long silence)*
> "Yeah. I know him."
> ### Soundtrack cue :

> ### Energy:
> **FORESHADOWING**
This is the start of Jody's descent into the mess.

>  Dennis is no joke.
The job sounds "quick"... but we know better.  
### Hints for later :
