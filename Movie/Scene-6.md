# Scene 6 - "Boat Ride Breakdown"
**Location:** open sea, off the coast of Trinidad
**Time** Just before dawn
**Visual Style:**
Grainy neon blue sky melting into black sea. Waves shimmer under low moonlight. Fog hangs low. Suspense builds with *every creak of the boat*.
### Characters:
**Jody** - eyes locked, gut feeling something's off
**Shorty** - talking to much
**Driver (Ras)** - dreadlocked, ex-smuggler, steady hand
**Dennis's Enforcer** - silent, suspicious
**Unknown Boat Following** - barely visible in mist
## Scene Breakdown:
Boat pushes off quietly from a jetty with **barrels sealed and chained**
Jody keeps scanning the horizon
Shorty jokes, trying to kill tension
**Second boat shadow appears** behind them
Enforcer whispers to driver: "We have company."
**Then-lights flash, Bullets rip the silence.**
###Dialogue :
**Ras (driver):**
*(shouting)*
"Hold on to yuh soul!"
**Shorty:**
"What the-bro, this wasnt part of the run" 
**Jody**
*(to Enforcer)*
"You bring heat on us?"
**Enforcer:**
*(raises gun)*
"Orders were dont stop. So we not stopping."
## Action Sequence:
Boat zigzags across waves
Return fire from Enforcer
Jody takes the wheel as Ras goes down
**One barrel is hit - dark liquid oozes . It's not feul. It's not rum.**
Jody sees **a strange symbol on the inside of the barrel** as it cracks open
He yells" "Thats not what we were moving!"
### Soundtrack cue :
** Kanye West - "Black Skinhead" (Island Remix)**
Drum-heavy, tribal rhythm, builds as boat speeds and bullets fly
### What this Scene unlocks:
Jody realises the job is bigger and **dirtier** than what Dennis said
He saw **something ritualistic** inside that barrel - weird symbols, black waxy substance
**This is no ordinary shipment.**
He's being setup for something darker...
### Closing Shot:
The second boat backs off
Jody drenched, holding the wheel
Shorty panting
Enforcer on the floor bleeding
Radio crackles:
"Did the cargo reach?"
Jody looks down at the broken barrel.
**Cut to black.**
