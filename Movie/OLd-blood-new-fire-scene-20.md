###visuals
Jody, Tulom and Shorty ride dirt bikes deeper into Tobago's untouched bush
A drone buzzes slightly overhead watching them through the trees
They reach an abandon cocoa estate ( lush overgrown and eerie
As they step inside the the estates drying shed, the trap is sprung
**Gunfire erupts** The crew dives for cover among broken baskets and beams
A local Casper appears, gun drawn, torn by regret
###Dialogue 
Tulom whispers "somethings off. The birds to quiet"
Jody with hand on machete-" you feel it too ?"
Casper yells " Ihad no choice Jody, they watching my daughter!
Shorty(furious)-"then yuh shoulda die first not kneel!
[Masked Gunmen]
"Order's was bring them alive, but yuh see what it is now" 
###Action
a violent ambush
Tulom tackles one gunman and **stabs with a broken cocoa stick**
Shorty lights a flare and tosses it into the bush-smoke blinds their persuers
Jody fights hand-to-hand, disarms a gunman, but gets grazed.
A shadowy *cartel enforcer* watches from a ridge above-
**identifiable only by a snake tattoo on his neck**
###NOTES
First major Tobago conflict
Shows how kevin's network reaches even here
Caspers betrayal is personal-he was like family back in the day
Jody's injury will affect next scenes-it;s minor, but symbolic
###Music cue
**"Revolution"-Damian Marley(instrumental-heavy cut)**
Used during the ambush sequence, switching to muffled slow-motion mid-battle
