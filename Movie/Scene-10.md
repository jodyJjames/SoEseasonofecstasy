# Scene 10 - "Shorty's Warning"
**Location** Shorty's apartment rooftop, St.James 
**Time:** Night-breezy, moonlit
**Characters:** Shorty, Kimi (DJ friend), Jody (via walkie) Tulom (hallucinated laughter), Helicopter overhead (brief moment)
### Visual Summary:
Shorty stands on a rooftop with antennas, bucket chairs, and an old BBQ pit.
He's scanning the skyline with binoculars, sipping something from a Carib bottle.
Kimi spins low-fi dub behind on a laptop, wearing LED headphones.
Jody comes in over the walkie, paranoid and out of breath.
Tulom's voice laughs randomly in Shorty's ear- Shorty pauses, rubs his temple
Helicopter lights sweep over the area briefly- Shorty ducks, pulls Kimi inside.
Ends in tight shot on Shorty's face as he whispers into the walkie:
*"The wolves movin"... And they hungry"*
### Dialogue:
**[Shorty]** *(to himself)* 
"Where the hell you now, boy...? you better not be in Diego."
**[Jody-viawalkie]**
"Shorty... they all over. I saw them by the pitch and behind the mosque. They walking with dogs and blades."
**[Shorty]**
"Damn. You bring the carnival back here too? Well done." *(pause)*
"Okay, listen. You need to come through the drain behind the bar. The whole block under siege."
**[Kimi]** *(yelling from inside)*
"Shorty! You see the light?"
**[Shorty]** *(quiet ,  into the walkie)*
"The wolves movin'... and they hungry."
### Scene Energy:
Rooftop strategy vibes- semi chill, but threat is rising.
Paranoia blends with party ambiance.
Hints of hallucination with Tulom's laughter echoing.
Visual contrast: dark city, glowing horizon, dancing lights, dread in the air.
### Music Cue:
**"Murder She Wrote" - Chaka Demus & Pliers (slowed and chopped remix)**
*Plays faintly from Kimi's speakers, echoing off the roof*
