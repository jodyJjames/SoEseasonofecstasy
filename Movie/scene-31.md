Coastal cliff near Toco, Trinidad
6.00pm golden hour
Tulom, Jody, (brief) Anya(new) Hummingbird(symbolic)
props- bottle of bush rum aka babash , ceremonial necklace ancestral map
Visual Tone- Lush and surreal-gold light, whispering trees, soft wind
###Visual summary
Tulom stands barefoot at the edge of the bluff, armsraised to the sky
His skin glistens with sweat and herbal oil
Behind him : Anya- a quiet mystic, watches from the tree line
###Dialogue
Tulom-(eyes closed, voice trembling) -"elder's say this land doh sleep - it dreams with we still walkn on it"
Anya-"and what does it dream, Tulom"
Tulom-(opens eyes wide)
"Rebellion. fire. A sea of men and women dancing barefoot while Babylon burns behind dem"
###Spiritual Peak
A *hummingbird* flits around Tulom's head 
He gasps, stepping back, stumbling onto his knees
Jody's voice enters in a soft echo "dont lose yuhself brother"
Tulom looksto the horizon- sees visions of smoke, celebration, and war
He screams-but it sounds like a call, not fear.
###Music cue
**"Guns of Navarone"-chronixx x major laser remix
dub echo , rootsy, powerful rise as the scene fades into the ocean
