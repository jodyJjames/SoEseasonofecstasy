### Scene breakdown:
Wide shot of the porch , sun casting long shadows
Mama rocking slowly, shelling peas into the trees
you hear the sound of the bush at dusk frogs, birds, crickets
A beat of silence...Then:
### Dialogue:
**Mama:**
>*(You still dont sleep right, do you?"

### Flashback Glimpse:
Jody (age 13) running through forest trails with a bloody shirt
Shadow barking wildly
Village kids watching him from behind fences
###Soundtrack Cue:
>**Sweetest Girl (Carnival Refix)" -Wyclef Jean ft Bunji Garlin**
### Emotional Tone:
Love. Regret. Secrets.
Jody's past is alive, not dead
Mamaknows something she never speaks about
She's trying to protect her son...even now.
