# 🎬 HIGH TIDE – The Movie (by Season of Ecstasy)

**HIGH TIDE** is the flagship cinematic project of the SoE Universe — a raw, stylish, high-stakes journey that mixes crime, culture, carnival, and consciousness.

## 🎥 Synopsis

Jody, a hustler born in the forested backroads of Trinidad, returns home for Carnival after years abroad. But this time, he’s carrying more than memories — he’s smuggling tech, secrets, and heat. Over one wild week, he navigates love, betrayal, vibes, hallucinations, and a massive international sting that could end it all.

> “A week in paradise, a lifetime of consequences.”

## 🌊 Style & Energy

Think:  
- **Project X** meets **City of God**  
- With the heat of **Belly**, the depth of **Top Boy**, and the rhythm of **Trinidad Carnival**

## 🧠 Vision

This is not just a movie. It’s an ecosystem.  
HIGH TIDE connects to:
- SoE game lore (playable characters, missions, and locations)
- The SoE animated series
- Real brands, artists, and music from T&T and beyond
- A global underground future where freedom is digital, tribal, and tropical

## 🎯 Goals

- Produce a Hollywood-grade film set entirely in the Caribbean
- Empower Caribbean voices, visuals, and culture
- Build global hype for SoE across all platforms (film, gaming, crypto, fashion)

## 📂 Suggested Subfolders

- `/Screenplay/` – full script + breakdowns
- `/Visuals/` – concept art, scenes, locations
- `/Soundtrack/` – licensed tracks, scoring
- `/Characters/` – bios, arcs, casting
- `/Trailer/` – teaser content and plan
