# Final Boss Cutscene :' When the drums stop'
## Setting:
The world turns pitch black. A single ancestral drum echoes across the void. The air vibrates with ancient tension. One by one, the folklore warriors vanish from the battlefield, pulled into a ritual trance. A glowing split forms in the earth - oozing a gold-and-ash mist. Out of it rises **The Enforcer**, an entity stitched from Caribbean fear itself. Chains drag behind him , soaked in sea brine and blood . His eyes hold every secret your grandmother never told you. The mist swirls violently. The jumbies howl in fear . The steelpan fades. And then... Silence:  Until the Enforcer whispers:  'The dead have chosen. Now we dance'
##Purpose.
This cutscene marks the transition to the **Final Battle**. It Shows that this isn't just a fight - its a spiritual reckoning .
##Visual Style:
Darkness broken only by flickers of folklore symbols (eg. La Diablesse's hooves, Soucouyant's fire, Lagahoo's chains)
Thick fog with golden fireflies.
Enforcer Floats slightly , not fully touching the ground.
##Audio
Distant tassa drums slowing down.
Whispered folklore chants layered in reverse.
Enforcer's voice: low, distorted, wrapped in reverb.
## Gameplay Transition: Once the cutscene ends, you immediately drop into **The Arena of Echoes**, with no loading screen - pure cinematic flow.
