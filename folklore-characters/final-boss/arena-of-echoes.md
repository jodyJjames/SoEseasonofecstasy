# Arena of Echoes - Final Showdown Stage
## Visual Setting:
Suspended in the spirit realm between life and death .
Sky is cracked with purple lightening,
ground is made of broken glass and ancestral masks.
Reflections show player's own character from earlier in the game, moving differently.
##Environment Hazards :
**Memory Pools** Glowing puddles trigger cutscenes of regret or failure. Standing in them too long weakens players ' controls temporarily
**Echo Walls** Invisible barriers shift and box players in suddenly - used to split up the squad.
**Spectral Winds** Every 90 seconds < a gust passes . if players arent crouched, it launches them into a spirit trap they must escape solo.
## Music Dynamics:
Music adapts to players' performance . 
when boss health is low, the beat intensifies into **ancestral drums and heavy dub**
If all players are down, silence falls. A single heartbeat keeps pulsing until someone revives.
##Interactive Elements:
**Ancestral Shrines**: Light these to disable certain boss abilities temporarily. Must be done in synchronized team rituals.
**Ghost Carnival** A parade of lost souls floats by mid-battle . touching any revives mana/stamina, but aggroes the souls for 15 seconds.
## Boss Enchancements in Arena:

Regains health from standing near shattered mirror fragments.
Can possess ancestral masks to perform unblockable attacks.
Shouts player names if idle for to long
stunning them in fear. 
**Escape Condition:
If players fail, the arena explodes in slow-motion. But if they win:
The mask of the Enforcer shatters into light.
A hidden portal opens to the **Legacy Hall**- where a player's entire journey is engraved and ranked.
