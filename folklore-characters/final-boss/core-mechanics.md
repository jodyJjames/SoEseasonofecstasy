# Final Boss Mechanics: The Enforcer
## Combat Philosophy:
The Enforcer is not just strong - he breaks the rules. He punishes predictable patterns and feeds off player fear . He doesnt just attack your character He attacks your **confidence**
##Phase Breakdown
### Phase 1; Chain Judgment 
Chains erupt from the ground like roots, grabbing at the players.
If caught, players are dragged into 'Memory Zone' - a 10-second hallucination of a past mistake ( based on previous gameplay).
Weak spots flash gold during chain windups.
### Phase @ : Echo Field
The battlefield splits into 3 echoes realms, each with distorted versions of past folklore enemies.
Players must defeat their own shadow to return.
Arena shrinks as time passes, increasing pressure.
### Phase 3; The Reckoning
Enforcer becomes semi transparent
Begins whispering the names of players( local username or character alias)
Every whisper lowers player stats unless they stay moving or dodge on rhythm.
Only 1 player at a time can damage him. Others must distract or cleanse the arena.
## Boss Traits:
Immune to stun and knockdown.
Can counter if attacked from behind more than twice.
Regenerates slightly during arena silence (when music drops out).
##Signature Move : "Backlash"
Reflects 200% of the last damage dealt backto all players.
Cooldown: 1 min.
Visual : Drums stop, then a soundwave blast drops like thunder.
##Weakness:
He cannot stand **light or joy**
The more vibrant,  dancing,  chaotic the team gets- the more his power fades.
HINTS:
wear carnival masks to confuse him.
Trigger ancestral chants at certain locations to seal off Echo realms.
