# Leagacy Hall - Post-Boss Reflection Chamber
The Legacy Hall a secret stage that opens only after defeating the Final Boss **without any team wipeouts** or **by triggering all Ancestral Shrines** mid flight.
## Visual Description
Endless corridor of floating marble slabs , each engraved with moments from the player.
Ghosts of past folklore champions salute as you pass.
##Gameplay Functions:
**Final Stats Display**: Total karma earned , ancestral favors collected, number of revives done, enemies defeated, and secrets found.
**Legacy Rank**: Playersrecieve a title(e.g., *"Storm Breaker"*, *"Midnight Soul"*,*"JabJab Descendant"*) based on choices and performance.
** Interactive Status:
Each major folklore character appears in stone form.
Players may **kneel, bow, or destroy** them - choices affect future sequels or expansion packs.
## Easter Eggs:
A mirror at the end of the hall shows your character as a jumbie version of yourself if you were corrupted by ego or revenge in game.
One golden mask on a pedestal silently asks: "**would you do it all again**"
## Replay Trigger:
Players may choose to "ascend" (game over with legacy saved) or ("reawaken" (New Game plus with extra abilities but new enemies)
## Music :
Calm pan flute with thunder in the distance.
Heartbeat fades as you walk toward the light.
