# 🪙 Crypto & High Tide Coin

Welcome to the financial engine of the **Season of Ecstasy (SoE)** universe.  
This folder powers the crypto layer behind the **High Tide Game**, **merchandise**, **real-world sponsors**, and **player rewards system**.

## 💠 High Tide Coin (HTC)

**High Tide Coin (HTC)** is a fictional-but-functional digital currency used across all SoE projects, with the potential to link into real-world blockchain ecosystems.

### 🔑 Core Features:

- Players earn HTC through missions, quests, or real-life achievements
- Real-world tie-ins through potential NFT rewards, merch discounts, and sponsor perks
